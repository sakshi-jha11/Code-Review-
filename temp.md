❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
function sum(){return a + b ;}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The function `sum` doesn't declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior as JavaScript will look for `a` and `b` in the scope chain, potentially finding them undefined or defined elsewhere.
*   ❌ The function lacks parameters. It should accept the numbers it's supposed to add as arguments.
*   ❌ There's no semicolon after the function definition, which is generally recommended for code consistency.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ Adds parameters `a` and `b` to the function definition, making it clear that it expects two arguments.
*   ✔ Returns the sum of the two input parameters `a` and `b`.
*   ✔ Includes a semicolon at the end of the function definition for code clarity and consistency.

Final Note:

Always ensure that functions explicitly define their dependencies (input parameters) to make their behavior predictable and avoid relying on variables from the outer scope. Properly defining function parameters enhances readability and reduces the risk of unexpected side effects.
